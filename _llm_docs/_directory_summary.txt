The specified directory, `LLMInterface`, is a crucial part of the project and serves as a communication layer between the system and an external Large Language Model (LLM).

- `LLMInterface.py` is responsible for sending class descriptions and system prompts to the LLM model and receiving generated responses from it through the `send_class_to_llm` function.
- `systemPrompts.py` contains the `PromptManager` class, which manages a set of predefined system prompts used when interacting with the LLM.

A separate script, `generate_docs.py`, is designed to generate structured documentation for source code files and directories in a given project using the Large Language Model (LLM) for content summarization. This script does not define any methods or properties related to the `LLMInterface` but utilizes it to gather class information during the documentation generation process.

In summary, both the `LLMInterface` and `generate_docs.py` work together to facilitate communication between the system and an external LLM, as well as generating structured documentation using the LLM for source code files in the project.
