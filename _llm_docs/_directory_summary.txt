The `LLMInterface` directory at `local_path/llm_classifier` contains Python scripts that facilitate communication with a Language Model (LLM) for classification purposes, primarily using the Mistral model.

The primary component in this directory is the `LLMInterface.py` file, which defines an interface to send class descriptions for classification and manages interactions with the LLM as part of its business logic.

Separately, systemPrompts.py is not part of this directory but serves another purposeâ€”defining and managing system prompts for interacting with the LLM. The PromptManager class within this file provides functions for adding and retrieving system prompts.

Outside of this directory, there exists a script named `generate_docs.py` (file path unspecified) that generates summaries of given directories' contents recursively. This file does not define any classes or interfaces but contains various functions to compute SHA256 hashes, process directories, and ensure the existence of specific directories for generating documentation.
