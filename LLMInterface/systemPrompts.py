- Begin with the file path (as provided externally).
- Give a one-sentence summary of the file’s overall purpose.
- List each class, struct, or interface defined in this file.
  - Under each class, list its methods and properties.
  - For each method, provide a short description of what it does (1–2 sentences).
  - Include line numbers of where each class and method is defined. for example: `ClassName (lines 10-50)`.
- Do not explain language syntax. Focus only on describing functionality.
- Keep the writing concise and technical, as if another developer will use this as a reference.
"""

Requirements:
- Begin with the directory path (as provided externally).
- Provide a paragraph that explains the purpose and role of this directory within the larger project.
