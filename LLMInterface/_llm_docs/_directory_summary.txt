### DIRECTORY: C:\Users\markh\source\repos\Documenatron\LLMInterface

#### Directory Purpose and Role:
The `LLMInterface` directory is part of a larger project aimed at enhancing documentation generation for software projects using language models (LLMs). It serves as an interface between the local LLM server and external applications, facilitating the extraction and processing of class definitions to generate detailed documentation. This integration leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities provided by the LLM to improve understanding and documentation of codebases.

#### Major Components:
1. **LLMInterface.py**:
   - **Purpose:** This script enables communication between a local LLM server and an external application, allowing it to send class definitions along with optional project context for generating detailed documentation or insights from the LLM.
   - **Methods:**
     - `send_class_to_llm(class_text: str, system_prompt: str, project_context: str = "", file_path: str = "") -> str`: Sends class definition and optional project context to an LLM server for detailed documentation generation.

2. **systemPrompts.py**:
   - **Purpose:** This file holds the system prompts used for interacting with a language model (LLM). It provides templates and configurations necessary for generating and managing prompt interactions within the application.
   - **Methods:**
     - `FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT` (line 3): Defines the structure of a file summary prompt, which is used to generate detailed documentation for individual files in the project.

### Summary of Files:
- **LLMInterface.py**: This Python script provides functions to interact with an LLM server by sending class definitions and optional project context. It constructs prompts dynamically based on provided inputs to facilitate detailed documentation generation.
- **systemPrompts.py**: Contains predefined system prompts for interacting with the LLM, tailored for generating file summary prompts used in the documentation process.
