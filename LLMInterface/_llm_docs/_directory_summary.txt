Directory Path: local_path/llm_classifier

This directory houses essential Python scripts for interacting with a Language Model (LLM) for classification purposes, primarily utilizing the Mistral model. The primary script, LLMInterface.py, serves as an interface to send class descriptions to the LLM for classification.

The LLMInterface.py file does not define any classes or structures but features the `send_class_to_llm()` function that communicates with the LLM API, sends class descriptions, and returns the response. This function constructs a POST request, sends it to the specified URL, processes the response stream line by line until it receives the classification result or encounters an error, skipping any exceptions during processing.

In a separate file (systemPrompts.py, unspecified path), a class named **PromptManager** is defined, focusing on managing interactions with the LLM and providing functions for adding and retrieving system prompts. This file does not contain any UI or data access components; instead, it serves as a bridge between the system and the business logic.
