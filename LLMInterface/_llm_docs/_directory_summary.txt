The specified directory contains two Python scripts: `LLMInterface.py` and `systemPrompts.py`.

The `LLMInterface.py` script provides functionality to interact with an external Large Language Model (LLM). It defines a single function, `send_class_to_llm`, which takes in a class description and a system prompt as input and sends them to the LLM model, returning the generated response.

On the other hand, `systemPrompts.py` contains a class called `PromptManager`. This class is designed for managing system prompts used when interacting with the LLM. It provides methods for adding, retrieving, and removing predefined prompts, allowing for easy modification or addition of these prompts as needed.

In summary, this directory houses utilities for communicating with an external LLM. The `LLMInterface.py` script handles the sending of class descriptions and system prompts to the model, while the `systemPrompts.py` script manages a set of predefined prompts for communication with the LLM. These components work together to facilitate interactions between the project and the external LLM model.
