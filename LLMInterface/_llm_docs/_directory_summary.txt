Directory Path: local_path/llm_classifier

This directory houses essential Python scripts that facilitate communication with a Language Model (LLM) for classification purposes, specifically utilizing the Mistral model. The primary file, LLMInterface.py, defines an interface to send class descriptions for classification.

In this directory, LLMInterface.py implements a function `send_class_to_llm()` that communicates with the LLM API, constructing POST requests and parsing responses line by line until it receives the classification result or encounters errors. It doesn't define any classes or structures but manages interactions with the LLM as part of its business logic.

Separately, systemPrompts.py is not specified in this directory but serves another purposeâ€”defining and managing system prompts for interacting with the LLM. The PromptManager class within this file provides functions for adding and retrieving system prompts, acting as a bridge between the system and business logic without any UI or data access components.
