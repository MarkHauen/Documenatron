### File Path: C:\Users\markh\source\repos\Documenatron\LLMInterface\LLMInterface.py

#### Summary of the file's overall purpose:
The Python script `LLMInterface.py` is designed to facilitate communication between a local language model (LLM) server and an external application, allowing it to send class definitions along with optional project context for generating detailed documentation or insights from the LLM.

#### Method Summary:
1. **send_class_to_llm(class_text: str, system_prompt: str, project_context: str = "", file_path: str = "") -> str**
   - **Description:** This function sends a class definition and optional project context to an LLM server for generating detailed documentation. It constructs the prompt with or without including the file path of the source code and appends system-specific prompts along with project context if provided. The response from the LLM is then processed line by line, extracting and returning the generated text.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `class_text: str`: The textual representation of the class to be sent to the LLM.
     - `system_prompt: str`: The base system prompt for the LLM interaction.
     - `project_context: str = ""`: Optional context about the project, which will be appended to the system prompt if provided.
     - `file_path: str = ""`: Optional file path of the source code containing the class; used in constructing the prompt for the LLM.
   - **Returns:** A string generated by the LLM based on the provided class definition and context, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.

#### Project Context:
This script is part of a larger project aimed at enhancing documentation generation for software projects using language models. It integrates with an LLM server running locally to provide detailed documentation for specific classes within a project by sending their textual representation along with contextual information about the project. This functionality supports better understanding and documentation of codebases through advanced natural language processing capabilities provided by the LLM.
